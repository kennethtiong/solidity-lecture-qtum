Solidity, the main programming language for Ethereum and other EVM-emulation chains like QTUM, is subject to many quirks. Building on Solidity can therefore be dangerous for the neophyte programmer without a knowledge of standardized libraries and safe patterns. In this talk, we'll go through several common exploits on Solidity.

We will have discussions and some live-demos on a grab-bag of topics based on several famous exploits:

Re-entrancy - Why you shouldn't transfer flow control to an untrusted contract before updating state (DAO hack)
Pseudorandomness - Why you shouldn't rely on any (pseudo) randomness within the EVM
DelegateCall - Why using DelegateCall as a catch-all forwarding mechanism is bad idea (Parity Hack)
ICO Contributions from Contracts - how some gamed the ICO contribution system in 2017 with contract addresses
Block Manipulation with Gas Limit - how to prevent changes of blockchain state that you're unhappy with
We hope to see you there!
